### Research Question
Does an increase in trade openness, measured by total trade volume and tariff levels, lead to a decline in industrial employment? 

### Thesis Statement
This study investigates whether greater trade openness, reflected by rising total trade volumes and falling tariff rates, contributes to a decline in industrial employment. By conducting separate regression analyses for OECD and developing countries, the research aims to identify differences in how trade dynamics influence industrial sectors across different economic contexts. Using cross-country panel data and variations in tariff levels over time, the study explores whether trade-friendly and trade-unfriendly periods have distinct impacts on industrial employment.

### Hypothesis
We hypothesize that greater trade openness, characterized by higher total trade volumes and lower tariff rates, is associated with a decline in industrial employment. Specifically, we expect that during trade-friendly periods (with lower tariffs and higher trade flows), industrial sectors experience more employment reduction compared to trade-unfriendly periods (with higher tariffs and restricted trade flows). Furthermore, we anticipate that this effect will be more pronounced in developing countries than in OECD countries, reflecting differences in industrial resilience and economic structures.

### Analysis Methods 
We visualized trends over time and examined the relationship between employment levels and export values through regression analysis. In addition, time series analyses are performed separately for each country, including correlation analysis, rolling correlation windows, stationarity tests (ADF test), and simple regressions of exports on employment.
